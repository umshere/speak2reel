**Running Celery (Development):**
1. Start Redis server: `redis-server` (or as per your Redis installation)
2. Start Celery worker from the 'webapp' directory (where manage.py is):
   `celery -A webapp_project worker -l info`
   (Ensure your Python environment has Django and Celery installed)
   For Windows, you might need: `celery -A webapp_project worker -l info -P eventlet`
   (and install eventlet: `pip install eventlet`)
